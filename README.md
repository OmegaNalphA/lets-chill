# Let-s-Chill
"A social platform for the socially lazy."

We've all been there. You and your friends want to hang out, but everyone is "down for whatever" so the plan never makes it farther than that. Let's Chill solves this problem with an innovative 4-field planning process with an interesting twist...

Every field is optional.
